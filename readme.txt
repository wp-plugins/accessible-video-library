Generates a library for your video information where you can upload caption files, include transcripts, and upload subtitles for other languages.

== Description ==

Accessible Video Library is intended to solve a problem in WordPress: the ability to manage videos and manage critical associated media including captions, transcripts, and subtitles for each video.

As of WordPress 3.6, WordPress has incorporated the MediaElements.js library for showing videos. It's a good library, and includes native support for captions and internationalization, is keyboard accessible, and supports YouTube.

However, the WordPress implementation doesn't provide any method to add captions, subtitles, or reference YouTube videos. You can always embed YouTube videos using oEmbed, but these videos don't have much at all in the way of keyboard support. 

Accessible Video Library gives you a custom post type that you can use to manage your video media. You can upload captions in .SRT format, upload subtitles also in .SRT format, use the content of the post to include the video transcript, and you can also reference YouTube videos. 

Additionally, you can upload multiple formats of your video files to improve the browser compatibility with your videos.
